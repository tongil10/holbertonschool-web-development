\# HTML Advanced Project WebPage



This project is the first step in building a webpage based on a Figma design. The goal here is \*\*to write the HTML structure only\*\* first, no CSS or JavaScript. We will be focusing on clean, semantic, and accessible HTML that will be the base for future styling, in a later version of the project.

\## 🎯 Goals



\* Recreate the layout of the Figma design using \*\*semantic HTML5 tags\*\* (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `footer`, etc.).

\* Do not include any CSS or inline styles.

\* The structure should reflect the design hierarchy only.

\## ✅ Requirements



\* Use semantic HTML tags.
